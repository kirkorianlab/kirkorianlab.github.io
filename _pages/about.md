The Cognitive Development and Media Lab is directed by Dr. Heather Kirkorian at the University of Wisconsin -- Madison. We study how children play, learn, and develop in the digital age. For example: 
_How do family stress and wellbeing relate to children's media use?_
_What types of educational media are most effective for preschoolers?_
_What is the impact of background television on play and parent-child interactions?_ 

__The Cognitive Development and Media Lab will _not_ be accepting new graduate students for the 2026-2027 academic year.__
