We study how children play, learn, and develop in the digital age. For example:</p> <p><em>How do family stress and wellbeing relate to children’s media use?</em></p> <p><em>What types of educational media are most effective for preschoolers?</em></p> <p><em>What is the impact of background television on play and parent-child interactions?</em></p> <p><strong>The Cognitive Development and Media Lab will <em>not</em> be accepting new graduate students for the 2026-2027 academic year.</strong></p> </body></html>
